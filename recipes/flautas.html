    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Certainly! Flautas are a delicious Mexican dish that involves tortillas
      rolled tightly around a flavorful filling, typically made with shredded
      meat, such as chicken or beef. The rolled tortillas are then deep-fried
      until they become crispy and golden brown. The word "flauta" translates to
      "flute" in Spanish, and the dish earned its name due to its flute-like
      appearance. Flautas are often served with toppings like guacamole, sour
      cream, and salsa, adding a delightful combination of textures and flavors
      to the overall experience. This culinary creation is not only tasty but
      also a wonderful representation of the rich and diverse Mexican cuisine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 Jalapeno</li>
      <li>1 whole Rotisserie Chicken (shredded)</li>
      <li>3 Green Chiles</li>
      <li>1 cup Shredded Cheese (Mexican blend)</li>
      <li>Fresh lime juices</li>
      <li>
        Seasonings (ground cumin, chili powder, salt, garlic powder, and
        paprika)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, cook the onion and jalapeño in a little bit of olive oil until
        softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the cooked onion, jalapeño, chicken,
        seasonings, green chiles, and lime juice. Stir in the shredded cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the freshest tortillas you can find, so they don't tear. I also
        recommend heating them up in the microwave for about 30 seconds so they
        are pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a flour tortilla on a flat surface. Add about 3 tablespoons of the
        filling to the bottom third of each tortilla then tightly roll up
        tortillas and place seam side down on the wire rack. Continue rolling
        until you are out of filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat canola or vegetable oil in a large skillet and use tongs to place
        the flautas one by one in the hot oil. Set them on a paper towel-lined
        plate after cooking!
