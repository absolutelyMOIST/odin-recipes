    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Crème Brûlée is a classic French dessert consisting of a rich custard
      base, typically made with egg yolks, sugar, and cream. The custard is
      flavored with vanilla and baked until it sets. What makes Crème Brûlée
      distinct is the caramelized sugar crust on top, created by sprinkling
      sugar on the surface and using a culinary torch to melt and brown it. The
      result is a delightful combination of creamy custard and a crisp, sweet
      layer, making it a decadent and indulgent treat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups heavy or light cream (or half-and-half)</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5 egg yolks</li>
      <li>½ cup granulated sugar, plus more for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and
        salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then
        discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a
        quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg
        mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place
        ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the
        sides of the ramekins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool
        completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in
        a thin layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on
        broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about
        5 minutes. Serve within 2 hours.
