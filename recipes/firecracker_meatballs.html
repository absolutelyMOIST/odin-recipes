    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Firecracker meatballs are a delightful culinary creation that combines the
      savory goodness of meatballs with a burst of fiery flavor. These
      delectable morsels are typically made by coating well-seasoned meatballs
      in a spicy sauce that adds a kick to every bite. The sauce often includes
      ingredients like hot chili sauce, sriracha, or other fiery elements,
      creating an explosive taste experience reminiscent of a burst of
      fireworks. Whether served as appetizers at a gathering or as a zesty
      addition to a meal, firecracker meatballs are sure to leave taste buds
      tingling and spice enthusiasts craving more.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 unit Scallions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon Honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Jasmine Rice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Korean Chili Flakes</li>
      <li>1 thumb Ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon Sour Cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds</li>
      <li>10 ounces Ground Beef</li>
      <li>6 ounce Green Beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings)
        and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and
        thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites.
        Peel and mince ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, honey, 2 tsp soy sauce
        (4 tsp for 4 servings; you’ll use the rest later), and sriracha to
        taste. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the
        sesame seeds (save the rest for serving); cook, stirring, until golden
        brown, 1-2 minutes. Add rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and
        a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low
        simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat
        until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        While rice cooks, in a second large bowl, combine beef, panko, ginger,
        scallion whites, remaining soy sauce, salt (we used ½ tsp; 1 tsp for 4
        servings), and pepper. Form into 10-12 (20-24 for 4)1½-inch meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place meatballs on one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet. On empty
        side, toss green beans with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on
        top rack until meatballs are cooked through and green beans are browned
        and tender, 14-16 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide between 2 sheets;
        roast meatballs on middle rack and green beans on top rack.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Divide between
        bowls or plates. Carefully add meatballs to bowl with sauce; toss to
        coat. Top rice with meatballs and drizzle with any remaining sauce.
        Serve green beans to the side. Garnish with scallion greens, remaining
        sesame seeds, and chili flakes to taste.
